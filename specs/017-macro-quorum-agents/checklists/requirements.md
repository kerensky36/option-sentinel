# Specification Quality Checklist: Macro News Voting Quorum

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) beyond what the user explicitly required (Google ADK, Vertex AI, named news publishers)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (3 questions resolved in Clarifications)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (advisory only; no trade execution; directional roll only)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Vertex AI, public RSS, constitution amendment)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Constitution Principle I requires amendment (v3.3.0) to permit the de-identified Vertex AI flow — handled in plan.md / research D-008.
